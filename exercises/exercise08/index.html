    <h1>Productivity Battle</h1>
    Productivity Battle is inspired by fitness tracking apps that allow users to challenge their friends in order to win virtual trophies or the top spot on the leaderboard. Productivity Battle invites users to challenge their friends in order to complete tasks on time and aims to turn productivity into a game. As players complete tasks, more of them get unlocked with the objective of completing the most to win. Users unlock a cycle of addiction, eventually becoming a robot aiming to cross off as many tasks as they can. The game never ends unless you choose to end it, and therefore, quitting your productivity streak altogether.
