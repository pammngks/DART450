# Assignment 2: Productivity Battle
This website aims to give order to our hectic day in a way that motivates you to be productive. Once you log in, you are assigned a 'teammate' or user to challenge. Together, you motivate one another to complete the most tasks within the day. The idea is that you are getting addicted to the game of being productive in order to beat your opponent. The more you spend time organizing your tasks or completing them, the more the web page becomes chaotic. You must now find order through the chaos, but with your addiction this shouldn't be a problem as you have now become a robot mindlessly completing tasks. If you choose to quit, you lose the challenge and your productivity streak altogether. Either way, the website is self destructing, so how do you win?

## Intervention
The web can be used as a way to organize our thoughts. This is evident through the various tools we use to keep us organized and on track of our goals. This website aims to form a critique on such tools and the idea of productivity, by using the web as a means of pushing ourselves to the limits.
