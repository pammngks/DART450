### Assignment 01: Interactive Personality
I see the internet as a means of creative expression through social media sites and various programs. I often find myself browsing the web for design inspiration whether it is through imagery such on Behance.net, or tutorial videos on YouTube. This inspiration is then taken to my canvas in Adobe programs such as Illustrator or Photoshop. While creating things or doing research, I often have a Spotify window open where I browse through a variety of music playlists to fit my mood. When exploring things around me on a daily basis, I use photography as a means to express my creativity. I keep a log of photos on my Instagram account, thus creating a harmony between the internet and digital technologies. All these websites or apps mentioned are things I constantly find myself visiting on a weekly, or sometimes, daily basis.  While I create a stream of photos on my Instagram account, a list of music playlists on Spotify, an archive of projects on Behance, or simultaneously watch YouTube tutorials as I work in Illustrator, all these apps have one thing in common. They are all able to be modified to my personal needs, as well as store an archive of information. For that reason, I decided to display my concept on a desktop environment in order to create an intimate setting. The folder marked "personal" on the desktop is there as a reminder that although we might be continuously connected to our digital technologies or the Internet, there will always be certain things we keep to ourselves behind our screens. We may be putting pieces of our personality out in the open web, but we still remain different and sometimes anonymous people behind those screens.

Icons:

Personal Folder: A restricted access folder accompanied by ResponsiveVoice when clicked.

Spotify: CSS animation to illustrate the music, accompanied by ResponsiveVoice mimicking a song.

Google Chrome: The use of arrays in order to showcase a random web page each time that it is opened.

Illustrator: The use of loops to creates circular divs on the canvas. Every time the page is opened the div elements change colors - in order to depict the ongoing iterative design process.
